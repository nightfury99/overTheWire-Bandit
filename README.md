## Introduction
Hello and Assalamualaikum. Today we gonna try to play [Bandit waqrgames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). To start this game, you must connect to the server by using any SSH client such as putty or MobaXTerm. You can use any operating system such windows, linux and mac, but if you are running virtual machine, it may failed to connect to overthewire.org server if it is configured to NAT. You may resolve it by changing NAT to Bridged Adapter.

## Level 0
The first is just pretty straight forward. We just need to connect to bandit.labs.overthewire.org server with username: `bandit0` and password `bandit0` on port 2220.

```
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
